neural,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), recurrent neural network (RNN), model interpretation, visual analytics",Visual Analytics for RNN-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,Junpeng Wang,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) targets to train an autonomous agent to interact with a pre-defined environment and strives to achieve specific goals through deep neural networks (DNN). Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE."
deep,"Time-varying data visualization, deep learning, super-resolution, generative adversarial network",SSR-TVD: Spatial Super-Resolution for Time-Varying Data Analysis and Visualization,Jun Han,"We present SSR-TVD, a novel deep learning framework that produces coherent spatial super-resolution (SSR) of time-varying data (TVD) using adversarial learning. In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.

deep,"Volume visualization, adaptive sampling, deep learning",Learning Adaptive Sampling and Reconstruction for Volume Visualization,Sebastian Weiss,"A central challenge in data visualization is to understand which data samples are required to generate an image of a data set in which the relevant information is encoded. In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering."
distribut,"Ensemble visualization, multi-parameter visualization, 3D rendering, distribution comparison, parallel coordinate",Visual Analysis of Multi-Parameter Distributions across Ensembles of 3D Fields,Josef Stumpfegger,"For an ensemble of 3D multi-parameter fields, we present a visual analytics workflow to analyse whether and which parts of a selected multi-parameter distribution is present in all ensemble members. Supported by a parallel coordinate plot, a multi-parameter brush is applied to all ensemble members to select data points with similar multi-parameter distribution. By a combination of spatial sub-division and a covariance analysis of partitioned sub-sets of data points, a tight partition in multi-parameter space with reduced number of selected data points is obtained. To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting. In two real-world application cases we show how our approach is used to analyse the multi-parameter distributions across an ensemble of 3D fields."
distribut,"Feature tracking, spacetime meshing, distributed and parallel processing, critical points, isosurfaces, vortices",FTK: A Simplicial Spacetime Meshing Framework for Robust and Scalable Feature Tracking,Hanqi Guo,"We present the Feature Tracking Kit (FTK), a framework that simplifies, scales, and delivers various feature-tracking algorithms for scientific data.  The key of FTK is our simplicial spacetime meshing scheme that generalizes both regular and unstructured spatial meshes to spacetime while tessellating spacetime mesh elements into simplices.  The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing.  The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces.  As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.  We demonstrate use cases as well as scalability studies through both synthetic data and scientific applications including tokamak, fluid dynamics, and superconductivity simulations.  We also conduct end-to-end performance studies on the Summit supercomputer.  FTK is open sourced under the MIT license: https://github.com/hguo/ftk."

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results."

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks."

Yet, researchers still lack systematic knowledge on how viewers verbalize their interpretations of visualizations, and how they interpret verbalizations of visualizations in such contexts. We describe two studies aimed at identifying characteristics of data and charts that are relevant in such tasks. The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of orrelations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language."

Interactive systems provide direct manipulation to create coordination between views, but are restricted to limited types of predefined templates. By contrast, textual specification languages enable flexible coordination but expose technical burden. To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs. The grammar design is informed by a novel framework based on a systematic review of 176 coordinations from existing theories and applications, which describes coordination by demonstration, i.e., how coordination is performed by users. With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions. We evaluate Nebula by demonstrating its expressiveness with a gallery of diverse examples and analyzing its usability on cognitive dimensions."

machine,"Exploratory visual analysis, interactive steering, visualization recommendation, machine learning",ChartSeer: Interactive Steering Exploratory Visual Analysis with Machine Intelligence,Jian Zhao,"During exploratory visual analysis (EVA), analysts need to continually determine which subsequent activities to perform, such as which data variables to explore or how to present data variables visually. Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer’s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity."

We build a recommendation engine by utilizing deep learning techniques to characterize good color design practices from data, and further develop InfoColorizer, a tool that allows users to obtain color palettes for their infographics in an interactive and dynamic manner. To validate our method, we conducted a comprehensive four-part evaluation, including case studies, a controlled user study, a survey study, and an interview study. The results indicate that InfoColorizer can provide compelling palette recommendations with adequate flexibility, allowing users to effectively obtain high-quality color design for input infographics with low effort."

recommend,"visual analysis, analytical workflow; discovery-driven analysis; visualization recommendations",Deconstructing Categorization in Visualization Recommendation: A Taxonomy and Comparative Study,Doris Jung-Lin Lee,"Visualization recommendation (VisRec) systems provide users with suggestions for potentially interesting and useful next steps during exploratory data analysis. These recommendations are typically organized into categories based on their analytical actions, i.e., operations employed to transition from the current exploration state to a recommended visualization. However, despite the emergence of a plethora of VisRec systems in recent work, the utility of the categories employed by these systems in analytical workflows has not been systematically investigated. Our paper explores the efficacy of recommendation categories by formalizing a taxonomy of common categories and developing a system, Frontier, that implements these categories. Using Frontier, we evaluate workflow strategies adopted by users and how categories influence those strategies. Participants found recommendations that add attributes to enhance the current visualization and recommendations that filter to sub-populations to be comparatively most useful during data exploration. Our findings pave the way for next-generation VisRec systems that are adaptive and personalized via carefully chosen, effective recommendation categories."
glyph,"Star glyph set, coordinate ordering, reinforcement learning, shape context",Shape-driven Coordinate Ordering for Star Glyph Sets via Reinforcement Learning,Ruizhen Hu,"We present a neural optimization model trained with reinforcement learning to solve the coordinate ordering problem for sets of star glyphs. Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training."

Taking cues from current tensor visualizations, we adapted glyph-based visualization for stress tensors in 3D space. We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field."
evalu,"task analysis, economic indicators, data visualization, animation, switches, software, shape, cartogram, geovisualization, interactive data exploration, quantitative evaluation",Task-Based Effectiveness of Interactive Contiguous Area Cartograms,Michael Gastner,"Cartograms are map-based data visualizations in which the area of each map region is proportional to an associated numeric data value (e.g., population or gross domestic product). A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as “easy to use” and “helpful.” Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen."
spatial,"Graph drawing, Voronoi tessellation, multi-level,

Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts."
spatial,"Multiscale visualization, spatially-controlled scale 
transition, visual abstraction, illustrative visualization, genome, DNA",Multiscale Unfolding: Illustratively Visualizing the Whole Genome at a Glance,Tobias Isenberg,"We present Multiscale Unfolding, an interactive technique for 
illustratively visualizing multiple hierarchical scales of DNA in a 
single view, showing the genome at different scales and demonstrating 
how one scale spatially folds into the next. The DNA's extremely long 
sequential structure---arranged differently on several distinct scale 
levels---is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its 
multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. 
Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is 
cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cut-aways. In contrast 
to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow 
viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For 
this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale 
transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale 
representation, while still linearly unfolding the DNA. Inspired by 
illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale 
zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent 
the spatial structure of the whole DNA macro-molecule, maintain its 
local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level 
organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation 
between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques 
that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within 
our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate 
the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to 
grasp the DNA's structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms, 
with increasing levels of ""unfoldedness,"" and can be applied in 
data-driven illustration and communication."

One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones. In this paper, we propose a visual analysis system, MissBiN, to involve analysts in the loop for making sense of link prediction results. MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole. We also provide a comprehensive usage scenario to illustrate the usefulness of the tool in an application of intelligence analysis."

We survey scenarios where comparing these embedding spaces is useful.
From those scenarios, we derive common tasks, introduce visual analysis methods that support these tasks, and combine them into a comprehensive system.
One of embComp’s central features are overview visualizations that are based on metrics for measuring differences in the local structure around objects.
Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences.
Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views.
Integrating and connecting all of these components, embComp supports a range of analysis workflows that help understand similarities and differences between embedding spaces.
We assess our approach by applying it in several use cases, including understanding corpora differences via word vector embeddings, and understanding algorithmic differences in generating embeddings.

real,"Volume rendering, global illumination, path-tracing, participating media, image-space filtering, real-time denoising",Real-Time Denoising of Volumetric Path Tracing for Direct Volume Rendering,Bochang Moon,"Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) using Volumetric Path Tracing (VPT) is a scientific visualization technique that simulates light transport with objects' matter using physically-based lighting models. Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy, failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to the volume transfer function."
sampl,"Volume visualization, adaptive sampling, deep learning",Learning Adaptive Sampling and Reconstruction for Volume Visualization,Sebastian Weiss,"A central challenge in data visualization is to understand which data samples are required to generate an image of a data set in which the relevant information is encoded. In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering."

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks."

In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance. In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle.

process," Information visualization, natural language generation, natural language processing, human-computer interaction",Words of Estimative Correlation: Studying Verbalizations of Scatterplots,Rafael Henkin,"Natural language and visualization are being increasingly deployed together for supporting data analysis in different ways, from multimodal interaction to enriched data summaries and insights. Yet, researchers still lack systematic knowledge on how viewers verbalize their interpretations of visualizations, and how they interpret verbalizations of visualizations in such contexts. We describe two studies aimed at identifying characteristics of data and charts that are relevant in such tasks. The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of orrelations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language."
process,"Data visualization, Uncertainty, Bars, Task analysis, Real-time systems, Query processing, Data analysis",Impact of Cognitive Biases on Progressive Visualization,Marianne Procopio,"Progressive visualization is fast becoming a technique in the visualization community to help users interact with large amounts of data. With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary."

The key of FTK is our simplicial spacetime meshing scheme that generalizes both regular and unstructured spatial meshes to spacetime while tessellating spacetime mesh elements into simplices.  The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing.  The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces.  As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.  We demonstrate use cases as well as scalability studies through both synthetic data and scientific applications including tokamak, fluid dynamics, and superconductivity simulations.  We also conduct end-to-end performance studies on the Summit supercomputer.  FTK is open sourced under the MIT license: https://github.com/hguo/ftk."

We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field."

Data that are mapped or otherwise visualized are also often emotive in nature, either inherently (e.g., climate change, disease mortality rates), or by design, such as can be found in visual storytelling. However, little is known about how the affective qualities of color interact with those of data context in visualization design. This paper describes the results of a crowdsourced study on the influence of affectively congruent versus incongruent color schemes on categorical map-reading response. We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design."

The term anthropographics has been recently coined to refer to this practice and the resulting visualizations. Anthropographics is a rich and growing area, but the work so far has remained scattered. Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research papers. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics."

Interactive systems provide direct manipulation to create coordination between views, but are restricted to limited types of predefined templates. By contrast, textual specification languages enable flexible coordination but expose technical burden. To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs. The grammar design is informed by a novel framework based on a systematic review of 176 coordinations from existing theories and applications, which describes coordination by demonstration, i.e., how coordination is performed by users. With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions. We evaluate Nebula by demonstrating its expressiveness with a gallery of diverse examples and analyzing its usability on cognitive dimensions."

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results."

Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts."

By a combination of spatial sub-division and a covariance analysis of partitioned sub-sets of data points, a tight partition in multi-parameter space with reduced number of selected data points is obtained. To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting.

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities."

In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.

The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models.

network,"Parallel processing, Distributed/network graphics, Visualization Topological Analysis",Unordered Task-Parallel Augmented Merge Tree Construction,Kilian Werner,"Contemporary scientific data sets require fast and scalable topological analysis to enable visualization, simplification and interaction. Within this field, parallel merge tree construction has seen abundant recent contributions, with a trend of decentralized, task-parallel or SMP-oriented algorithms dominating in terms of total runtime. However, none of these recent approaches computed complete merge trees on distributed systems, leaving this field to traditional divide and conquer approaches. This paper introduces a scalable, parallel and distributed algorithm for merge tree construction outperforming the previously fastest distributed solution by a factor of around three. This is achieved by a task-parallel identification of individual merge tree arcs by growing regions around critical points in the data, without any need for ordered progression or global data structures, based on a novel insight introducing a sufficient local boundary for region growth."

Supported by a parallel coordinate plot, a multi-parameter brush is applied to all ensemble members to select data points with similar multi-parameter distribution. By a combination of spatial sub-division and a covariance analysis of partitioned sub-sets of data points, a tight partition in multi-parameter space with reduced number of selected data points is obtained. To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting. In two real-world application cases we show how our approach is used to analyse the multi-parameter distributions across an ensemble of 3D fields."

Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy, failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to the volume transfer function."

Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch).

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary."

The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

The key of FTK is our simplicial spacetime meshing scheme that generalizes both regular and unstructured spatial meshes to spacetime while tessellating spacetime mesh elements into simplices.  The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing.  The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces.  As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.  We demonstrate use cases as well as scalability studies through both synthetic data and scientific applications including tokamak, fluid dynamics, and superconductivity simulations.

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks."

coordin,"Star glyph set, coordinate ordering, reinforcement learning, shape context",Shape-driven Coordinate Ordering for Star Glyph Sets via Reinforcement Learning,Ruizhen Hu,"We present a neural optimization model trained with reinforcement learning to solve the coordinate ordering problem for sets of star glyphs. Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training."

A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as “easy to use” and “helpful.” Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen."

In this work, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated."

Taking cues from current tensor visualizations, we adapted glyph-based visualization for stress tensors in 3D space. We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field."

In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting. In two real-world application cases we show how our approach is used to analyse the multi-parameter distributions across an ensemble of 3D fields."

The key of FTK is our simplicial spacetime meshing scheme that generalizes both regular and unstructured spatial meshes to spacetime while tessellating spacetime mesh elements into simplices.  The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing.  The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces.  As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.  We demonstrate use cases as well as scalability studies through both synthetic data and scientific applications including tokamak, fluid dynamics, and superconductivity simulations.  We also conduct end-to-end performance studies on the Summit supercomputer.  FTK is open sourced under the MIT license: https://github.com/hguo/ftk."

human,"Multi-attribute sorting, decision making, interpretability, human predictability, predictive interpretability",Imma Sort by two or more attributes with Interpretable Monotonic Multi-Attribute Sorting,Yan Lyu,"Many choice problems often involve multiple attributes which are mentally challenging, because only one attribute is neatly sorted while others could be randomly arranged. We hypothesize that perceiving approximately monotonic trends across multiple attributes is key to the overall interpretability of sorted results, because users can easily predict the attribute values of the next items. We extend a ranking principal curve model to tune monotonic trends in attributes and present Imma Sort to sort items by multiple attributes simultaneously by trading-off the monotonicity in the primary sorted attribute to increase the human predictability for other attributes. We characterize how it performs for varying attribute correlations, attribute preferences, list lengths and number of attributes. We further extend Imma Sort with ImmaAnchor and ImmaCenter to improve the learnability and efficiency to search sorted items with conflicting attributes. We demonstrate usage scenarios for two applications and evaluate its learnability, usability, interpretability and user performance in prediction and search tasks. We find that Imma Sort improves the interpretability and satisfaction of sorting by ≥ 2 attributes. We discuss why, when, where, and how to deploy Imma Sort for real-world applications."
human,"data uncertainty, data visualization, implicit error, qualitative study, digital humanities, design study, archaeology","Implicit Error, Uncertainty and Confidence in Visualization: an Archaeological Case Study",Georgia Panagiotidou,"While we know that the visualization of quantifiable uncertainty impacts the confidence in insights, little is known about whether the same is true for uncertainty that originates from aspects so inherent to the data that they can only be accounted for qualitatively. Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities."

Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences.
Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views.

Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer’s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity."

In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.

In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering."
learn,"Star glyph set, coordinate ordering, reinforcement learning, shape context",Shape-driven Coordinate Ordering for Star Glyph Sets via Reinforcement Learning,Ruizhen Hu,"We present a neural optimization model trained with reinforcement learning to solve the coordinate ordering problem for sets of star glyphs. Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training."

Despite the enhanced performance and efficiency of HFL over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of HFL. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the HFL process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the HFL model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the HFL process. In this study, strictly following the HFL privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the HFL process termed HFLens, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Specifically, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients' information in one or different communication round(s), the identification of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each HFL client. Two case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the HFL process better."

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE."

In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance. In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle. We have developed a river visualization and a hybrid visualization that combines a scatterplot, a node-link diagram, and a bar chart, to convey the label propagation of graph-based SSL. Based on the understanding of the propagation, a user can select regions of interest to inspect and modify the graph. We conducted two case studies to showcase how our method facilitates the exploitation of labeled and unlabeled samples for improving model performance."

We propose a data-driven method that provides flexibility by considering users’ preferences, lowers the expertise barrier via automation, and tailors suggested palettes to the spatial layout of elements. We build a recommendation engine by utilizing deep learning techniques to characterize good color design practices from data, and further develop InfoColorizer, a tool that allows users to obtain color palettes for their infographics in an interactive and dynamic manner. To validate our method, we conducted a comprehensive four-part evaluation, including case studies, a controlled user study, a survey study, and an interview study. The results indicate that InfoColorizer can provide compelling palette recommendations with adequate flexibility, allowing users to effectively obtain high-quality color design for input infographics with low effort."

One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones.

MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole.

In this work, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated."

Our approach is based on a hierarchical representation of the input data and the fast identification of topologically invariant vertices, which are vertices that have no impact on the topological description of the data and for which we show that no computation is required as they are introduced in the hierarchy. This enables the definition of efficient coarse-to-fine topological algorithms, which leverage fast update mechanisms for ordinary vertices and avoid computation for the topologically invariant ones. We demonstrate our approach with two examples of topological algorithms (critical point extraction and persistence diagram computation), which generate interpretable outputs upon interruption requests and which progressively refine them otherwise. Experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our progressive strategy, in addition to the continuous visual feedback it provides, even improves run time performance with regard to non-progressive algorithms and we describe further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. We illustrate the utility of our approach in batch-mode and interactive setups, where it respectively enables the control of the execution time of complete topological pipelines as well as previews of the topological features found in a dataset, with progressive updates delivered within interactive times."

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary."

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running.

To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.

VIS30K’s comprehensive coverage of the scientific literature in visualization not only reflects the progress of the field but also enables researchers to study the evolution of the state-of-the-art and to find relevant work based on graphical content. We describe the dataset and our semi-automatic collection process, which couples convolutional neural networks (CNN) with curation. Extracting figures and tables semi-automatically allows us to verify that no images are overlooked or extracted erroneously. To improve quality further, we engaged in a peer-search process for high-quality figures from early IEEE Visualization papers. With the resulting data, we also contribute VISImageNavigator (VIN,visimagenavigator.github.io), a web-based tool that facilitates searching and exploring VIS30K by author names, paper keywords, title and abstract, and years."
data,"Dual Analysis approach, High-dimensional data, Mixed data, Mixed statistical analysis",Integrated Dual Analysis of Quantitative and Qualitative High-Dimensional Data,Juliane Müller,"The Dual Analysis framework is a powerful enabling technology for the exploration of high dimensional quantitative data by treating data dimensions as first-class objects that can be explored in tandem with data values. In this work, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated."

A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as “easy to use” and “helpful.” Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen."
data,"Topological data analysis, scalar data, progressive visualization",A Progressive Approach to Scalar Field Topology,Julien Tierny,"This paper introduces progressive algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data. Our approach is based on a hierarchical representation of the input data and the fast identification of topologically invariant vertices, which are vertices that have no impact on the topological description of the data and for which we show that no computation is required as they are introduced in the hierarchy. This enables the definition of efficient coarse-to-fine topological algorithms, which leverage fast update mechanisms for ordinary vertices and avoid computation for the topologically invariant ones. We demonstrate our approach with two examples of topological algorithms (critical point extraction and persistence diagram computation), which generate interpretable outputs upon interruption requests and which progressively refine them otherwise. Experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our progressive strategy, in addition to the continuous visual feedback it provides, even improves run time performance with regard to non-progressive algorithms and we describe further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. We illustrate the utility of our approach in batch-mode and interactive setups, where it respectively enables the control of the execution time of complete topological pipelines as well as previews of the topological features found in a dataset, with progressive updates delivered within interactive times."
data,"Spatial cascade, pattern mining, spatiotemporal data",Visual Cascade Analytics of Large-scale Spatiotemporal Data,Zikun Deng,"Many spatiotemporal events can be viewed as contagions. These events implicitly propagate across space and time by following cascading patterns, expanding their influence, and generating event cascades that involve multiple locations. Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges, 1) generalized pattern inference, 2) implicit influence visualization, and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts."

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks."

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities."
visual,"Exploratory visual analysis, interactive steering, visualization recommendation, machine learning",ChartSeer: Interactive Steering Exploratory Visual Analysis with Machine Intelligence,Jian Zhao,"During exploratory visual analysis (EVA), analysts need to continually determine which subsequent activities to perform, such as which data variables to explore or how to present data variables visually. Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer’s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity."

Yet, researchers still lack systematic knowledge on how viewers verbalize their interpretations of visualizations, and how they interpret verbalizations of visualizations in such contexts. We describe two studies aimed at identifying characteristics of data and charts that are relevant in such tasks. The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of orrelations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language."

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results."

In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.

One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones. In this paper, we propose a visual analysis system, MissBiN, to involve analysts in the loop for making sense of link prediction results. MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole. We also provide a comprehensive usage scenario to illustrate the usefulness of the tool in an application of intelligence analysis."

We find that there is little to no agreement in ordering of rainbow colors while sequential colors are indeed intuitively ordered by the participants with a strong dark is more bias. Sequential colors facilitate most quantitative map reading tasks better than the rainbow colors, whereas rainbow colors competitively facilitate extracting specific values from a map, and may support hue recall better than sequential. We thus contribute to dark- vs. light is more bias debate, and demonstrate why and when rainbow colors may impair performance, and add further nuance to our understanding of this highly popular, yet highly criticized color scheme."
visual,"Volume visualization, adaptive sampling, deep learning",Learning Adaptive Sampling and Reconstruction for Volume Visualization,Sebastian Weiss,"A central challenge in data visualization is to understand which data samples are required to generate an image of a data set in which the relevant information is encoded. In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering."

We survey scenarios where comparing these embedding spaces is useful.
From those scenarios, we derive common tasks, introduce visual analysis methods that support these tasks, and combine them into a comprehensive system.
One of embComp’s central features are overview visualizations that are based on metrics for measuring differences in the local structure around objects.
Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences.
Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views.
Integrating and connecting all of these components, embComp supports a range of analysis workflows that help understand similarities and differences between embedding spaces.
We assess our approach by applying it in several use cases, including understanding corpora differences via word vector embeddings, and understanding algorithmic differences in generating embeddings.

visual,"Color, visualization, emotion, design, cartography",Affective Congruence in Visualization Design: Influences on Reading Categorical Maps,Cary L. Anderson,"Recent work in data visualization has demonstrated that small, perceptually-distinct color palettes—such as those used in categorical mapping—can connote significant affective qualities. Data that are mapped or otherwise visualized are also often emotive in nature, either inherently (e.g., climate change, disease mortality rates), or by design, such as can be found in visual storytelling. However, little is known about how the affective qualities of color interact with those of data context in visualization design. This paper describes the results of a crowdsourced study on the influence of affectively congruent versus incongruent color schemes on categorical map-reading response. We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design."
visual,"Neural networks, architecture visualization, graph layouting",Net2Vis - A Visual Grammar for Automatically Generating Publication-Tailored CNN Architecture Visualizations,Alex Bäuerle,"To convey neural network architectures in publications, appropriate visualizations are of great importance. While most current deep learning papers contain such visualizations, these are usually handcrafted just before publication, which results in a lack of a common visual grammar, significant time investment, errors, and ambiguities. Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study. It not only reduces the time needed to generate network visualizations for publications, but also enables a unified and unambiguous visualization design."

While dimensionality reduction techniques can be utilized to reduce the analysis space, these may unintentionally bury key dimensions within a larger grouping and obfuscate meaningful patterns. With this work we introduce DimLift, a novel visual analysis method for creating and interacting with dimensional bundles. Generated through an iterative dimensionality reduction or user-driven approach, dimensional bundles are expressive groups of dimensions that contribute similarly to the variance of a dataset. Interactive exploration and reconstruction methods via a layered parallel coordinates plot allow users to lift interesting and subtle relationships to the surface, even in complex scenarios of missing and mixed data types. We exemplify the power of this technique in an expert case study on clinical cohort data alongside two additional case examples from nutrition and ecology."

illustratively visualizing multiple hierarchical scales of DNA in a 
single view, showing the genome at different scales and demonstrating 
how one scale spatially folds into the next. The DNA's extremely long 
sequential structure---arranged differently on several distinct scale 
levels---is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its 
multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. 
Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is 
cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cut-aways. In contrast 
to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow 
viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For 
this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale 
transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale 
representation, while still linearly unfolding the DNA. Inspired by 
illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale 
zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent 
the spatial structure of the whole DNA macro-molecule, maintain its 
local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level 
organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation 
between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques 
that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within 
our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate 
the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to 
grasp the DNA's structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms,

visual,"Data visualization, Uncertainty, Bars, Task analysis, Real-time systems, Query processing, Data analysis",Impact of Cognitive Biases on Progressive Visualization,Marianne Procopio,"Progressive visualization is fast becoming a technique in the visualization community to help users interact with large amounts of data. With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary."

Supported by a parallel coordinate plot, a multi-parameter brush is applied to all ensemble members to select data points with similar multi-parameter distribution. By a combination of spatial sub-division and a covariance analysis of partitioned sub-sets of data points, a tight partition in multi-parameter space with reduced number of selected data points is obtained. To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting. In two real-world application cases we show how our approach is used to analyse the multi-parameter distributions across an ensemble of 3D fields."

Taking cues from current tensor visualizations, we adapted glyph-based visualization for stress tensors in 3D space. We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field."
visual,"Federated learning, anomaly detection, contribution assessment, visualization",Inspecting the Running Process of Horizontal Federated Learning via Visual Analytics,Quan Li,"As a decentralized training approach, horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a machine learning model while keeping personal/private information on local devices. Despite the enhanced performance and efficiency of HFL over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of HFL. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the HFL process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the HFL model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the HFL process. In this study, strictly following the HFL privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the HFL process termed HFLens, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Specifically, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients' information in one or different communication round(s), the identification of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each HFL client. Two case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the HFL process better."

Decision makers rely on data analysis, which is either delegated to analysts, or done on their own. Often the decision maker combines data, likely uncertain or incomplete, with non-formalized knowledge within a multi-objective problem space, weighing the recommendations of analysts within broader contexts and goals. As most past research in visual analytics has focused on understanding the needs and challenges of data analysts, less is known about the tasks and challenges of organizational decision makers, and how visualization support tools might help. Here we characterize the decision maker as a domain expert, review relevant literature in management theories, and report the results of an empirical survey and interviews with people who make organizational decisions. We identify challenges and opportunities for novel visualization tools, including trade-off overviews, scenario-based analysis, interrogation tools, flexible data input and collaboration support. Our findings stress the need to expand visualization design beyond data analysis into tools for information management."

However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE."

For example when the p-value is small enough or the CIs of the mean effects of a studied drug and a placebo are not overlapping, scientists tend to claim significant differences while often disregarding the magnitudes and absolute differences in the effect sizes. This type of reasoning has been shown to be potentially harmful to science. Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to reduce such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has also been challenged. We ran two experiments on researchers with expertise in statistical analysis to compare several alternative representations of confidence intervals and used Bayesian multilevel models to estimate the effects of the representation styles on differences in researchers' subjective confidence in the results. We also asked the respondents' opinions and preferences in representation styles. Our results suggest that adding visual information to classic CI representation can decrease the tendency towards dichotomous interpretations - measured as the `cliff effect': the sudden drop in confidence around p-value 0.05 - compared with classic CI visualization and textual representation of the CI with p-values.

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks."

Interactive systems provide direct manipulation to create coordination between views, but are restricted to limited types of predefined templates. By contrast, textual specification languages enable flexible coordination but expose technical burden. To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs. The grammar design is informed by a novel framework based on a systematic review of 176 coordinations from existing theories and applications, which describes coordination by demonstration, i.e., how coordination is performed by users. With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions. We evaluate Nebula by demonstrating its expressiveness with a gallery of diverse examples and analyzing its usability on cognitive dimensions."

We propose a data-driven method that provides flexibility by considering users’ preferences, lowers the expertise barrier via automation, and tailors suggested palettes to the spatial layout of elements. We build a recommendation engine by utilizing deep learning techniques to characterize good color design practices from data, and further develop InfoColorizer, a tool that allows users to obtain color palettes for their infographics in an interactive and dynamic manner. To validate our method, we conducted a comprehensive four-part evaluation, including case studies, a controlled user study, a survey study, and an interview study. The results indicate that InfoColorizer can provide compelling palette recommendations with adequate flexibility, allowing users to effectively obtain high-quality color design for input infographics with low effort."
visual,"visual analysis, analytical workflow; discovery-driven analysis; visualization recommendations",Deconstructing Categorization in Visualization Recommendation: A Taxonomy and Comparative Study,Doris Jung-Lin Lee,"Visualization recommendation (VisRec) systems provide users with suggestions for potentially interesting and useful next steps during exploratory data analysis. These recommendations are typically organized into categories based on their analytical actions, i.e., operations employed to transition from the current exploration state to a recommended visualization. However, despite the emergence of a plethora of VisRec systems in recent work, the utility of the categories employed by these systems in analytical workflows has not been systematically investigated. Our paper explores the efficacy of recommendation categories by formalizing a taxonomy of common categories and developing a system, Frontier, that implements these categories. Using Frontier, we evaluate workflow strategies adopted by users and how categories influence those strategies. Participants found recommendations that add attributes to enhance the current visualization and recommendations that filter to sub-populations to be comparatively most useful during data exploration. Our findings pave the way for next-generation VisRec systems that are adaptive and personalized via carefully chosen, effective recommendation categories."

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities."
